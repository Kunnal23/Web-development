# The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp by Dr.Angela Yu.

## This repository contains *most* of the projects and tasks I completed during Angela Yuâ€™s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The course covers the MERN stack, with a twist - instead of *MongoDB*, I learnt *PostgreSQL*. Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on exercises and full projects that helped me build comprehensive skills in frontend and backend development using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
